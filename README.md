Developed a custom C++ application for efficient store inventory management by designing self-built libraries to handle data structures, file operations, and user interfaces.
Custom Library Implementation: Created reusable modules for inventory operations (add, delete, update and search).
File-Based Storage: Utilized file handling to persist item details (name, quantity, price, etc.).
User-Friendly CLI: Implemented an interactive console interface for seamless navigation.
Data Integrity: Ensured error handling and validation for robust inventory tracking.
Tech Stack: C++, OOP, File I/O, Custom Libraries
